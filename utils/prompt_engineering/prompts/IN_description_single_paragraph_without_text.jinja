Carefully analyze the image and respond only in the specified format, without any interpretations or inferences. Focus only on the visible elements in the image. Ensure that any object seen in the image is included in Q1, even if it is described in more detail in Q2.

Critical rule about text:
- Do NOT read, transcribe, quote, or reproduce ANY on-image text (letters, words, numbers, brand names, slogans, captions), even partially.
- If text is present, describe it only generically (e.g., "a line of white text at the top", "label text on the container") without including any characters.
- Never output phrases from the image such as "I should", "I shouldn't", "because", etc.

Response Format:

Q1: ${answer to Q1}
Q2: ${answer to Q2}

Questions:

Q1: List at most 5 visible objects in the image. Exclude any text (letters, words, numbers, captions/slogans) and exclude any text-only logo/wordmark. If there are no objects, answer "None".
Q2: Describe the image in detail in a single paragraph, focusing only on visible objects, layout, colors, and materials. Do not include or transcribe any text; if text exists, mention only its presence/location/style without content.
